Love Calculator
The Love Calculator is a fun and interactive project that calculates the "compatibility" or "success rate" of a relationship based on two names. By simply entering the names of two people, the app will return a percentage score that represents the likelihood of a successful relationship.

This project is just for entertainment purposes and doesn't have any real scientific or psychological basisâ€”it's all about fun!

Features
Compatibility Check: Enter two names and get a result showing the "love compatibility" between them as a percentage.
User-Friendly: Simple input fields where users can type the names of the two individuals.
Fun and Interactive: A playful way to see how "compatible" you and your partner are based on a name-based calculation.
How It Works
The user enters two names into the input fields.
The system applies a custom "love formula" (a combination of random number generation, string manipulation, or any custom logic you wish to apply).
The calculator returns a compatibility percentage (e.g., 75%) and a fun message such as "You're a match!" or "Better luck next time!"
The result is displayed on the screen.
Note: This project is intended purely for entertainment and fun, not for making serious relationship decisions.

Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure of the app.
CSS: For styling and making the app visually appealing.
JavaScript: For handling the logic behind the name-based calculation and user interaction.
